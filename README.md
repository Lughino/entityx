Node.js EntityX
=======

# Introduction
EntityX is a node.js module for the managment of the model/driver layer of an application.

It derives from the need to provide a tool that allows you to give a methodical structure to the data management application layer.

It's NOT an ODM and the automations provided are restricted at some pattern and simple operations on the persistence layer.

It allows the arrangement of the code in modules and provides a Factory object built for the instantiation of the classes.
